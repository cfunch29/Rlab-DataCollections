## Data Collections 

### Objectives
- Use arrays to store ordered lists of data.
- Use objects to store keyed lists of data.
- Use conditional logic to process data.
- Use loops to handle repetitive tasks.
- Transform data according to specifications.

## Part 1 - Refactoring Old Code 
- Refactoring code is the process of restructuring the code without changing the original behavior. 
- Knowing what we now know about arrays and objects, how would we change the approach to this problem? 

## Part 2 - Expanding Functionality
1. Declare a variable that stores the number of columns in each row of data within the CSV
    - dynamic variable based on the first row of data (use arrays and strings)
        - each row = array/container * **square bracket notation** * 
        - contents of the row = string
    - now make it 2-dimensional
        - use "push" to make the rows 2D
    - create a new variable for the 2D array 
        - call 2D array something 
    - Cache 2D array in variable for later

## Part 3 - Transforming Data 


## Part 4 - Sorting and Manipulating Data

## Part 5 - Full Circle
- Transform data back into a CSV formatted string
